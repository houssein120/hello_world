Software that constructs the de Bruijn graph of a set of reads (FASTA file).
Edges are the (k+1)-mers that appear in the reads, nodes are the k-mers.
This structure is useful for many next-generation sequencing applications,
including de novo genome assembly.

For k <= 32, this implementation uses max(64*N/p,64*G) bits of memory, where:
- N is the number of k-mers present in the reads (N = number of reads * (read length - k +1))  
- G is the number of different k-mers in the genome (G = roughly the size of the genome). 
- p is the number of passes (specified by option -p in the software). 

For 3 billion k-mers, assuming sufficiently many passes, it should construct the graph in 24 Gb of memory. 

For 32 <= k <= 64, the constant 64 becomes 128. K-mers larger than 64 nucleotides are not supported.
